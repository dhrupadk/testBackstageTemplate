# Postmortem - CAM API P2 Postmortem (incident INC19030199)

## Incident Date

Date: 2022-11-03

## Authors

Mitch Jenkins, Bryan Taylor

## Status

### Complete

## Summary

Cloud Account Master (CAM) Application Programming Interface (API) in Microsoft Flow was in an error condition. Security Scorecard Dashboard is not displaying expected values.

## Impact

### Security Scorecard Dashboard is unsuable

Cloud Security scorecard shows security violations for accounts under Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Operators/Developers use this tool to easily track and remediate security findings that they are in violation of. Without having awareness of findings, the potential security risks are obscured. Security vulnerability notifications also call the API to receive owners and technical contacts to send emails.

## Detection

User

## Root Cause

* CAM API was in an error condition, returning an HTTP 504 to the client. Security Dashboard consumes CAM API and did handle the error condition of CAM API.
* Because GetAccounts endpoint received HTTP 504 response from API call to Sharepoint list
* Because Sharepoint API could not parse response body due to data mismatch in result filter query - Expected type 'person', received type 'group' in field 'Financial_Sponsor'
* (Final) Because CAM UI allowed self-service user to enter type 'group' in field 'Financial_Sponsor'

## Resolution

Cloud Operations Support removed the bad user data and replaced with valid data.

### Initial Troubleshooting Steps (Product Team)

* Identified failures in flow (all) - not able to process the record
* Stopped the flow and restarted - GetAccounts
* Checked the logs, saw failures, but wasn't aware to dig into the details

### Resolution Steps (SRE Team)

* Looked into details to find error in API Portal flow - saw failure from `GetAccounts` endpoint with HTTP 504 error
* Looked into error details in `GetAccounts` flow - error originated from Sharepoint API call to get accounts
* Quickly copied the `GetAccounts` flow to manipulate Sharepoint API filter query
* Limiting results returned, returned a successful reponse with results; thus, the connection was working.
* Requesting more results failed, as the original
* Based on a previous experience, memory served that bad data in the result would not meet the expected schema
* Navigated to Sharepoint List UI to easily view all details of data
* Filtered data by recently modified
* Checked 'People' type fields first as previously 'strings' in these fields have broken the service previously
* Found value in `Financial Sponsor` that was not a person
* Leveraged CAM UI to update the value to the owner's senior manager, by definition
* Data change resolved the issue - validated in Power Automate flow logs
* Looked into why the bad data could be input - the value populated when searched in CAM UI
* Looked at Sharepoint List field settings and field allowed for 'People and Groups' - however, API response schema is only configured for 'People' and break when there is a group or other data type

## Action Items

Action Item   |Type   | Owner |	Bug    
---           | ---   | ---   | ---
Validate user input in CAM - change field settings to 'People only' | prevent | Chofer Core | JIRA xyz
Handle unexpected errors in CAM AWS API | prevent | Chofer Core | JIRA xyz
CloudSec to migrate Security Dashboard to consume CAM (AWS) APIs | prevent | CloudSec (Security Dashboard owners) | JIRA xyz
CloudSec to handle errors from CAM API | prevent | CloudSec (Security Dashboard owners) | JIRA xyz
CloudSec to cache static data to prevent losing all data when limited records have bad data | prevent | CloudSec (Security Dashboard owners) | JIRA xyz
CloudSec to use different strategy for pulling data (individually rather than all at once) | prevent | CloudSec (Security Dashboard owners) | JIRA xyz

## Lessons Learned

### What went well

Cloud Operations had the correct access and understanding to restore CAM API, which in turn resolved the issue

### What went wrong

* Not knowing how to use the monitoring
* Alert email only sent to one person (original flow owner) - missed
